            <h3>Volunteer Experience</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><i>Ten Thousand Villages (January 2015 - April 2015)</i></li>
                <li>Description: Ten Thousand Villages is a non-profit organization that partners with small-artisan groups and workshops in third-world countries
                to bring their wares to our markets. By doing so, this ensures that the artisans have a safe and healthy place to work, while making a decent wage.
                The stores at Ten Thousand Villages are volunteer ran; the only staff member that gets paid is the manager. Volunteers are essential to keep the stores
                running because they unbox the merchandise, take inventory, organize the store layout, cash customers up, and most importantly, promote fair trade.
                Ten Thousand Villages is also eco-conscious. The video below will give some insight on some eco-friendly merchandise that is for sale. </li>
