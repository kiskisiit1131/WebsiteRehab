    <h1>StormCTF Shmoocon 2020 Raffle Walkthrough</h1>
    <h2>Updated On: 01/28/2020 </h2>
    <p> Unfortunately I didn't win the raffle, but I still thought the challenge was pretty interesting and they said it was ok to make
    a write up of it (although as I'm writing it I feel like I'm rubbing salt on the wound).</p>
    <h3> Challenge </h3>
    <p>The challenge page was basically just some text and their logo, so I downloaded the image for further investigation.</p>
    <img src="storm_ss/logo.png" alt="logo">
    <p>This reminded me of some previous CTF challenges where messages can be hidden in the strings of an image file. I used
    the "strings" Linux command to search for a few different keywords; "http" was the winner.</p>
    <img id="command_screenshot" src="storm_ss/strings_result.png" alt="strings result">
    <p> The pastebin link leads to a ciphertext dump. For the decryption portion, I used my favorite Ascii to Hex website
    <a href="https://www.asciitohex.com/">(linked here)</a> to solve this challenge.</p>
    <img src="storm_ss/pastebin.png" alt="pastebin">
    <p>I suspected Base64 due to the mix of letters and numbers, so let's try pasting it in there first to see what we get.</p>
    <img src="storm_ss/encoding_1.png" alt="first encoding">
    <p>The text now looks very hexadecimalish since the only letters in the text are between A and F. Let's try pasting this
      into the hexadecimal box on the page next.</p>
    <img src="storm_ss/encoding_2.png" alt="second encoding">
    <p>This was the only place I felt unsure on this challenge because of the equal sign in the beginning. What type of encoding does
    that? Well...none of them do. However, if you swap all of the characters around to make it Base64, I wonder what would happen.</p>
    <img src="storm_ss/reverse_order.png" alt="reverse order">
    <p>Since I'm a firm believer in working smart, not hard (within reason), I found <a href="https://www.browserling.com/tools/text-reverse">this website</a>
    which did the dirty work for me. Now let's paste that back into the Ascii to Hex website for Base64 and see what we get.</p>
    <img src="storm_ss/encoding_3.png" alt="third encoding">
    <p> It's hexadecimal again! Time for more copy pasta.</p>
    <img src="storm_ss/encoding_4.png" alt="fourth encoding">
    <p>Another Base64 encoding? Will the encoding ever end?</p>
    <img src="storm_ss/huzzah.png" alt="flag">
    <p> Huzzah! We found the flag! It's a shame I didn't win, but I applaud the creativity for this challenge. This is the most encoding I've ever seen
    in an image related CTF challenge. You have to admire their persistence.</p>
